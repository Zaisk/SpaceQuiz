# CIM443 ~ Project1
## Space Trivia

### Instructions
> *For the first project, it’s all about making HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together. How can your website listen – and respond to – user actions? You can build a fun guessing game (like a quiz) about any topic you like, or even turn it into a survey to make it serious.*

`Simple space theme trivia quiz. 8 questions, using simple user-friendly UI. Counts total number of questions correct out of 8. Has a prebuilt 'bounceIn entrance' and infinite shooting star loop to make it look extra spacey.`

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://zaisk.github.com/SpaceQuiz).
